Messages came in through email and Twitter from health care workers who were feeling desperate because their supply of personal protective equipment was dwindling.\n\"I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm a nurse and we are scrambling for PPE,\" wrote one nurse.\nBut they weren't really asking for me. They were asking to be put in touch with one of my sources, Dr. Peter Tsai of Knoxville. He responded quickly to these calls for help, even late at night.\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic, Tsai was far from a household name. Even though he was well-respected as a materials scientist and inventor, very few people had heard of him.\nUntil now.\nCOVID-19 had dragged one of Tsai's inventions into the spotlight. He is the creator of the filter material inside most disposable N95 respirators. As the pandemic worsened, health care workers nationwide needed the masks to stay safe, which means there were shortages and massive price markups.\nThe shortage was so dire that it brought Tsai out of retirement to dive head-first into solving the crisis.\nSince mid-March, Tsai has been a worldwide force on two fronts \u2014 finding new ways to sterilize disposable respirators for reuse and rapidly scaling up their production.\n\u201cMy invention is just an ordinary invention,\u201d the 68-year-old said humbly in an interview with Knox News. \u201cBut because of the need for the respirators, people think it is very important.\u201d\nTsai\u2019s invention is not new. He filed the first patent for the filtration technology back in 1995. His invention gives the masks' filter fabric a permanent electrostatic charge by exposing it to a halo of electricity. Scientists call this an electrical \u201ccorona.\u201d Tsai named his process \u201ccoronal charging.\u201d\nThe coincidence between the names is not lost on Tsai.\n\u201cI use coronal charging to fight coronavirus,\u201d he joked.\nTsai has had a long career in textile manufacturing and engineering. He graduated from what is now National Taipei University of Technology in 1975. He worked for several years in manufacturing before moving to the U.S. in the 1980s to get a doctorate in materials science at the University of Kansas.\nDuring his research career at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, Tsai developed his filtration technology further while pursuing other projects. He holds 12 U.S. patents in filtration technology and other areas.\nWhile his material and production processes made a huge difference in the world, it wasn\u2019t front-page news. He retired in late 2019. Then you know what happened this year.\n\u201cI felt very stressed in the very beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a lot of pressure and a lot of questions.\u201d\nHe knew the kinds of stress the respirators could tolerate, and he published these thoughts in the Journal of Emergency Medicine in a special emergency article. He turned his home into a lab and published more results.\nOne group donated an ozone machine commonly used in hospital sterilization to see if that would work. Tsai boiled and steamed masks. He borrowed a neighbor\u2019s oven to see if masks could be safely heated using common kitchen appliances. He exposed respirators to sunlight. The masks were then tested again to see if they lost filtration power.\nOzone was a no-go because it ruined elastic or rubber ear loops. Wet heat had to be applied carefully to avoid deforming the masks. Home ovens heated too unevenly and inaccurately. Alcohol ruined the filters. Other techniques, like dry heat and hydrogen peroxide, seemed more promising.\nBut Tsai couldn\u2019t fully test every technique, nor could he validate that it killed viruses. This worried him.\n\u201cI started wondering whether people were using my methods without validation,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cIf it does not really sterilize the mask and people reuse them, then we would have a lot of trouble.\u201d\nHe reached out to other scientists and got in touch with a team at the University of Tennessee Medical Center to validate his approaches. N95DECON, an interdisciplinary research group, also got in touch. It ran its own tests to validate some of his suggestions in addition to others.\nN95DECON recommends versions of some of Tsai\u2019s initial approaches for sterilization. Its validation studies cite communications with Tsai and the experiments of over a hundred N95DECON members. Their results echo some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggestions for mask sterilization.\nBut reusing masks is only half the battle.\nThe world faces a critical supply shortage. Few domestic suppliers make N95 filtration material. Half the world\u2019s N95 masks are manufactured in China. The Food and Drug Administration recently deauthorized many models of N95 masks from being reused.\nUnbeknownst to Tsai, Oak Ridge National Lab was gearing up to try to address the problem.\n\u201cWe have a lab-wide initiative effort on COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Merlin Theodore, director of the Carbon Fiber Technology Facility at ORNL. She explained that the facility was struggling to come up with a way to convert its machines to make the filter fabric and was looking to enlist local experts.\nDr. Lonnie Love, a lead scientist in ORNL\u2019s COVID manufacturing task force, remembered Tsai but couldn\u2019t put his finger on why.\n\u201cHe remembered the name and couldn\u2019t remember why so he asked his wife,\u201d Theodore said. As it turns out, Tsai was neighbors with Love\u2019s mother-in-law. After that, they quickly made contact.\n\u201cHe came that very same week, fully suited up. He brought his own equipment,\u201d Theodore said. \u201cHe reminded me of someone going to war.\u201d\nWith Tsai\u2019s expertise, the team at ORNL was able to quickly convert its carbon fiber processing facility into a filtration cloth facility. Within a week it was able to produce filter cloth. Theodore says it\u2019s impossible to say how much time Tsai\u2019s involvement saved.\n\u201cJust imagine the amount of experiments you\u2019d have to run to determine a process that works,\u201d Theodore said. \u201cThat can average from months to years. But we didn\u2019t have to because he had already done all the experiments.\u201d\nThe ORNL facility can produce enough material for roughly 9,000 masks per hour. It's shipping the material to academic and national labs for research purposes. Theodore explained that for the market, ORNL worked with industry partners to get the fiber technology into domestic manufacturers' hands quickly.\nA spokesperson for ORNL confirmed that it had assisted a filtration material manufacturer based out of Cookeville, Cummins, with the installation of equipment to produce Tsai's filter technology.\nTsai said this was far from the only consulting work he had been doing. He said he\u2019d been doing pro-bono consulting work and research around the clock.\nTheodore said Tsai vigorously tried to turn down payment for his work with ORNL but had to be paid per ORNL policy. Tsai said that being helpful during this time was all that mattered to him.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for me to contribute to the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can do this, it will be a good memory for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThe work has not been without its toll. Tsai said that since the start of the pandemic, he had lost 10 pounds, but he was optimistic.\n\u201cSomeone said I should get a Nobel Prize,\u201d Tsai joked. \u201cBut what I deserve is a \u2018No Belly\u2019 prize.\u201d", "url": "https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2020/06/19/n-95-filter-inventor-who-became-hero-coronavirus-pandemic-peter-tsai/5310257002/"}, {"authors": ["Matt Egan", "Cnn Business"], "date_download": "2020-07-19 01:39:15", "date_modify": "2020-07-19 01:39:15", "date_publish": "2020-07-14 11:29:56", "description": "Verizon hasn't laid off any of its 135,000 employees during the pandemic.

Instead, the company has retrained around 20,000 workers for new careers.\nIt's part ofresponsible business plan announced Tuesday. Dubbed Citizen Verizon, the plan includes a pledge to prepare 500,000 mostly lower-wage people for jobs of the future by 2030 through skills training and job advancement tools.\nWhile it's an expensive endeavor as other companies cut costs \u2014 millions of Americans are now collecting unemployment because of the unprecedented health crisis chose to focus on retraining workers, CEO Hans Vestberg told CNN Business in an exclusive interview.\n\"Verizon, as a large corporation, needs to take actions and be responsible here,\" said Vestberg, who became CEO two years ago , later adding, \"Large corporations have far bigger impacts than governments even, sometimes. We feel that responsibility as a corporation.\"\nThe retraining programs will aim to teach vulnerable populations \u2014 especially those whose jobs are threatened by automation \u2014 digital skills and provide the mentorship needed to thrive in the modern economy. Verizon said the focus will be on lower-wage workers, including those who work in factories, restaurants and as drivers. There will be an emphasis on young, Black and Hispanic workers who have not gone to college.\nAs part of Citizen Verizon, the company is creating an education platform designed to support hybrid learning models being used in school districts across the United States. Verizon said the platform will provide digital literacy training for parents, remote learning resources for teachers and tech guidance for school districts. The program aims to provide 10 million children with digital access and skills training by 2030.\nBiden calls for end of 'shareholder capitalism.' Verizon says it's already there\nIn May, Verizon ranked No. 1 in a Forbes and JUST Capital list of the responses to the pandemic among America's top publicly traded employers.\n\"Many of the decisions you're taking in a crisis like this, they will follow you for years because this is when people, customers, employees will remember how we acted,\" Vestberg said.\nVerizon said it spent nearly $216 million last year in learning and development programs its employees.\nThe comments come amid a broader debate over the role of Corporate America. Last year, the Business Roundtable said corporations are responsible for improving society by serving all stakeholders \u2014 not just shareholders\nJoe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, declared in a major speech last week that he will end the era of \"shareholder capitalism.\"\nEricsson ERIC Vestberg, a former senior executive at Swedish telecom giant, said that's \"how we act\" every day: \"We want a positive outcome for all of our stakeholders because ultimately, to have a successful and growing company, the only way is actually to manage your customers, your shareholders, your employees and society.\"\nBut Vestberg stresses that doesn't mean Verizon isn't still focused on making money.\n\"We should grow because ultimately that gives us the liberty to actually act on all the stakeholders,\" he said.\nCorporate America is 'not doing enough' to fix inequality\nBut the recent protests around racial inequality suggest that far too many Americans have been left behind in the modern economy.\nThe median net worth of white households is about 10 times the median net worth of Black households , according to the Federal Reserve. The median income for Black households less than 60% of that of white households.\n\"It's clear they're not doing enough,\" Vestberg said of efforts by large companies to narrow those gaps. \"Every corporation, every organization needs to do this better in order to create more equality, both here in the US but also in the rest of the world.\"", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/14/business/verizon-jobs-ceo-hans-vestberg/"}, {"authors": [], "date_download": "2020-07-19 01:39:18", "date_modify": "2020-07-19 01:39:18", "date_publish": "2020-07-17 15:17:50", "description": "Agripolis, an urban farming firm, is beginning to produce fruit and vegetables for businesses and citizens in Paris with the largest rooftop farm on earth.", "filename": "__1595122758.html", "image_url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rooftop-garden-in-paris-Agripolis-released.jpg", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/kaorumurai/news-please-repo//data/2020/07/19/goodnewsnetwork.org/__1595122758.html", "title": "The Largest Urban Rooftop Farm in the World is Now Bearing Fruit (and More) in Paris", "title_page": "The Largest Urban Rooftop Farm in the World is Now Bearing Fruit (and More) in Paris", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "goodnewsnetwork.org", "maintext": "Getting fresh produce into the heart of a major city used to be done by a fleet of rumbling, polluting trucks\u2014now it\u2019s a matter of bringing it down from the roof.\nThe largest urban rooftop farm in the world uses vertical growing techniques to create fruits and vegetables right in the center of Paris without the use of pesticides, refrigerated trucks, chemical fertilizer, or even soil.\nNature Urbaine uses aeroponic techniques that are now supplying produce to local residents, including nearby hotels, catering halls, and more.

Growing on 3.4 acres, about the size of two soccer pitches, atop the Paris Exhibition Center, they are also producing about 150 baskets of strawberries, as well as aubergines, tomatoes, and more.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Pascal Hardy, a sustainable development consultant and member of Agripolis, an urban farming firm, called the Nature Urbaine project in Paris \u201ca clean, productive and sustainable model of agriculture that can in time make a real contribution to the resilience\u2014social, economic and also environmental\u2014of the kind of big cities where most of humanity now lives.\u201d\nRELATED: Trailblazing Gardener Discovers How to Grow Vegetables in Winter\u2014Now He\u2019s Helping Others Do It Too\nSci-Fi Farming\nCurrently only a third of the total space on hall 6 of the expo center is utilized for Pascal\u2019s alien-looking garden, and when the project is finished, 20 staff will be able to harvest up to 2,200 lbs (1,000 kg) of perhaps 35 different kinds of fruits and vegetables every day.\nIn plastic towers honeycombed with little holes, small amounts of water carrying nutrients, bacteria, and minerals, aerate roots which hang in midair.\nAs strange as the pipes and towers out of which grow everything other than root vegetables might seem, Hardy says the science-fiction farming has major benefits over traditional agriculture.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d he begins, \u201cbut I don\u2019t much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different pesticides, or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases.\u201d\nMORE: Kroger Buys and Redirects Dairy Farmers\u2019 Excess Milk, Sending 50,000 Gallons Per Month to Food Banks\n\u201cIt uses less space. An ordinary intensive farm can grow nine salads per square meter of soil; I can grow 50 in a single tower. You can select crop varieties for their flavor, not their resistance to the transport and storage chain, and you can pick them when they\u2019re really at their best, and not before.\u201d\nBreaking the chain\nAgripolis is currently discussing projects in the U.S., the UK, and Germany, and they have finished several other rooftop farms in France including one on the roof of the Mercure hotel in 2016, which cultivates eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and cherry tomatoes, salads, watercress, strawberries, nasturtiums and aromatics all directly serving the hotel restaurant.\nGrowing on the roof and selling on the floor can play a big part in the production of carbon-neutral food because, according to Agripolis, fruit and veg on average travel by refrigerated air and land transport between 2,400 and 4,800 kilometers from farm to market.\nThe global transportation force is the largest of humanity\u2019s carbon-emitting activities, and reducing the number of flights and truckloads of produce is a great place to start cutting the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere.\nFor a culinary city like Paris, the Parisian mayor\u2019s proposal to install an additional 320 acres (130 ha) of rooftop and wall-mounted urban farming space could significantly reduce the number of trucks entering the city, easing traffic and reducing pollution.\nWith rooftop farming being embraced from Detroit to Shanghai, the future is looking up.\nSHARE This Bountiful Good News With Friends On Social Media\u2026", "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-largest-urban-rooftop-farm-in-the-world-is-now-bearing-fruit-and-more-in-paris/"}]
